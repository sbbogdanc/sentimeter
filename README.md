# Sentimeter

## Sentiment Analysis Model on Vertex AI with Hugging Face ðŸ¤—

This project showcases building and deploying a text sentiment classification model. The model is developed by finetuning [BERT][bert], a popular NLP foundational model from [Hugging Face][hf]. 

To facilitate model development, deployment, and management, the project leverages various services including [Vertex AI][vertex], [Pytorch SDK][pytorch], [Artifact Registry][ar], [Cloud Build][cb], [Cloud Deploy][cd] and [Cloud Storage][cs]. 

## Notebook

You can build and deploy the model on Vertex AI Workbench, which is a Jupyter notebook-based development environment. Start by [creating][vertex-wb] a Vertex AI Workbench instance and [cloning][vertex-wb-git] this GitHub repository in your instance. Then, you can open the [notebook](notebook.ipynb) within your Vertex AI Workbench instance.
